## Travel and Commuting

The entrance to the Beltway is just 1 mile away – with the Route 66 interchange just a couple of miles beyond that. And we are about 100 feet from two Metrobus lines. But more important, we’re about 2 miles away from [Metro](http://www.wmata.com) (both [Dunn Loring](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=102) and [West Falls Church](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=101)). You can walk there on snowy days. We are also only 1/2 mile from the [Washington and Old Dominion (W&OD)](http://www.nvrpa.org/park/w_od_railroad) bike trail.
