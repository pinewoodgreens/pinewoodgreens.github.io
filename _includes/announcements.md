#### Annual Meeting of Homeowners

Our annual meeting of homeowners is March 25, 2020 at 7 PM in the community center. This year, there are two proxies to complete - an Annual Meeting Proxy and a Special meeting proxy. Even if you plan to attend the meeting, it is very important that you return both proxies as a quorum of the majority of owners is required in order for the Association to conduct business. 

You can drop off signed hard copies at the office (there is a box outside), mail them to the office, or email a scan or photo to office@pinewoodgreens.com.

We will be raffling Amazon gift cards to people who have submitted theirs, so be sure you donâ€™t miss out!

If you've misplaced the letter and proxy forms from Pinewood Greens, electronic copies are available at the links below:
