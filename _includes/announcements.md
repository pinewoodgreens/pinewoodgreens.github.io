#### Annual Meeting of Homeowners

Our annual meeting of homeowners is March 25, 2020 at 7 PM. Due to meeting restrictions for the coronavirus, the annual and special meetings will be done via Zoom, a virtual meeting tool. Please join with a computer or smartphone by using this link:

To dial in by phone only, call 312-626-6799, and enter webinar ID 151 986 864 when prompted.

This year, there are two proxies to complete - an Annual Meeting Proxy and a Special meeting proxy. Even if you plan to attend the meeting, it is very important that you return both proxies. 

If we do not have enough homeowners attend via proxy or in person on the 25th, we will adjourn and reschedule to a later date between 30 and 60 days from the 25th, per our governing documents. As of March 21, we are still 20 proxies short of the number required to hold the meeting. 

You can drop off signed hard copies at the office (there is a box outside), mail them to the office, or email a scan or photo to office@pinewoodgreens.com.

If you've misplaced the letter and proxy forms from Pinewood Greens, electronic copies are available at the links below:
