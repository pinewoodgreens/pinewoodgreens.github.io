                            <p class="whitetext">OUse our socially distanced scavenger hunt to explore our beautiful and abundant common areas in the neighborhood. Flyers will be distributed by September 1, and will also be available at https://1drv.ms/b/s!AljaksoYYp5SgfQoT9puPLSslv4pNQ?e=GDua4B to print.
Here's how it works:
Between Tuesday, September 1 and 5 PM Tuesday, September 8, search for the answers on the question sheet, fill it out, and return one of the following ways:
1) Drop in the mail slot in the black mailbox next to the front door of the community center, or
2) Take a legible photo of the question and answer sheet and email it to social@pinewoodgreens.com
</p>
                            <p class="whitetext"><a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AljaksoYYp5SgfQoT9puPLSslv4pNQ?e=GDua4B"</a></p>
                            <p class="whitetext">Only one answer sheet may be submitted per household. Remember, responses are due by 5 PM on Friday, September 8.
All correctly completed question sheets will be entered into a random drawing for one of several gift cards to a local nursery or home improvement center. Check back here for specific prize information, to be posted soon. 
We hope that everyone enjoys getting out to explore our neighborhood!</p>
